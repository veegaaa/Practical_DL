## Practice

This week's practice is just as usual: pick one of two notebooks (theano or tf) and follow instructions inside.

However, there are two alternative assignments (both in theano) that you can do _instead of_ main assignment: 
* 1d convolutions for prohibited content filtering
* 1d convolutions for music processing
